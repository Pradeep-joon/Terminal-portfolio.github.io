I have develop a terminal- web-based terminal emulator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code you provided sets up event listeners for 
key presses and defines a router function to handle different commands entered in the terminal. Here's an overview of the code:

- The variables `before`, `command`, `textarea`, and `terminal` are used to get references to various HTML elements in the document.
- The `commands` array stores all the entered commands.
- The `enterKey` function is called when a key is pressed. It handles different key events such as Enter, Arrow Up, and Arrow Down.
- The `router` function is the command router that determines what action to take based on the entered command.
- The `printLines` function is used to print the contents of an array line by line.
- The `addLine` function adds a new line to the terminal.
- The `openNewTab` function is used to open a link in a new tab.
- The code also defines various constants for social media links, certificates, and projects.
- There are arrays with text content for different commands such as `help`, `about`, `certificates`, `social`, and `projects`.

Overall, this code sets up the basic functionality for a terminal emulator and defines the behavior for different commands. You can extend 
the code by adding more commands and functionality as needed.
